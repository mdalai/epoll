# App Development Guide

This guide outlines the steps for developing your application efficiently.

## Gemini Added Memories
- When starting a new session in a project, I should check for a `GEMINI.md` file in the root directory. If it exists, I should read it to understand the project's specific guidelines and context.

## 1. Review Requirements
- Refer to `ai/feature_requirements.md` for project requirements.

## 2. Review Tech Stack & Best Practices
- See `ai/tech_stack.md` for technology stack details.
- **Strictly** follow best practices in `ai/ng_best_practices.md` (Angular & TypeScript).

## 3. Follow the Implementation Plan
- Use the step-by-step plan in `ai/todo.md`.
- After completing each task:
  1. Verify the functionality of the implemented task by creating and running a test.
  2. Confirm completion with the user.
  3. Mark the item as done in `ai/todo.md`.
  4. Announce the next task to be started.
